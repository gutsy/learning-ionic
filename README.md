# learning-ionic
Just me messing around with the Ionic framework to learn it for a project at work. 

This uses the Ionic framework, which uses Angular under the hood and TypeScript. 

Follow the directions here to get Ionic started: https://ionicframework.com/getting-started

Instead of using the command `ionic serve` to serve this one, use the command `ionic serve --lab` to open it in the "lab" which has iOS, Android and Windows phone emulators.
